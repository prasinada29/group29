            <div class="montserrat">
              <p>Do you live in a city where there are irritating noises of cars and factories everywhere and smoke coming out of everywhere you could possibly imagine? Then Prasinada is the best city for you.</p>

              <p><b>“Health and well being of its residents has been the topmost priority of the city management.” - Mayor</b></p>

              <p>This city is for people who have always wanted to become one with nature and haven’t been able to because of the fact that where there is nature, there are no luxurious or essential facilities and vice versa. But Prasinada is the perfect combination of nature and all the luxury you could ever think of. Preserving the resources of nature and maintaining greenery is the biggest priority in the city along with maintaining the happiness of the people.</p>

              <p>The city has almost zero carbon emission due to the fact that everything here is used and built keeping in mind that nature can not be harmed in any way whatsoever. Harming nature in any way is a criminal offense and could result in imprisonment.</p>

              <p>The city is built in such a way that it is directly connected to the main highway of the country while connecting to other neighboring cities through other domestic roads.</p>

              <p>A city can not be made green until the neighboring cities are green too, therefore Prasinada helps other cities too to attain zero-carbon emission so that everyone can enjoy nature’s beauty while living in the most luxurious way possible.</p>

              <p>To get to know more about how the city’s government works, the waste management system, maintenance of greenery, energy production and transportation, keep reading. If you want to learn only about a particular aspect of the city, feel free to use the navigation bar to navigate.</p>

            <div class="montserrat">
              <p>This city is founded by Abhyudit Singh, Utkarsh Srivastav, and Arnav Khandelwal. All the city's founders are the city’s current co-mayors until the first election takes place 3 years later. This would start the cycle of periodic elections taking place once every 5 years to elect one main mayor who in turn would elect other ministers of the city.</p>

              <p>This would ensure minimal corruption as the ministers would be under the direct control of the mayor.</p>

              <p>If the people of the city feel like any minister or the mayor himself is not doing his job accurately, they can file a complaint at the main HR office of the city which in turn will take the required actions.</p>

              <p>If more than 70% of the population of the city files a complaint against any minister or mayor in a single month, a new minister would be appointed or re-elections would take place respectively. </p>

              <p>The people are the most important part of the city and thus there will be no tolerance with anyone who misbehaves with any citizen of the city. Strict actions will be taken against the person regardless of the person’s gender, community, or race.</p>

              <p>The judiciary of the city will work independently and no one can influence the judgment of the judiciary, not even the mayor. The judiciary would be made of a judge and a jury, made of 12 citizens, to ensure that the perfect verdict is given.</p>

            <div class="montserrat">
              <p>According to the planning of the city, the budget given to build would obviously be exceeded. So the mayors found some ways to increase capital.</p>

              <p>The main capital would come from the resources available in the city itself. Other resources would be bought from neighbouring cities and factories in bulk at lower prices.</p>

              <p>Goods would be bought directly from the producers and without involving other people in between. By this method the goods would be bought at the lowest prices possible.</p>

              <p>The city has a local river that goes through the city so there is no need for "buying" water. Moreover, the city believes in Rain Water Harvesting. The water collected still is not compatible for drinking, so it goes through filtration and then becomes fit for drinking.</p>

              <p>The city would be taking loans from the neighbouring cities which would be payed off not by returning money but by providing resources that these cities do not have but are abundant in PRASINADA.</p>

            <div class="montserrat">
              <p>The education system of the city is inspired by Finland and partially from The United States of America. Basic education starts at the age of seven, and instead of dividing it into elementary and junior high, it offers single-structure education for nine years. Almost all teaching is done on digital platforms.</p>

              <p>Most teachers hold a master's degree, and basic-ed teachers are required to hold them.</p>

              <p>Students are graded not by periodic tests and their ability to mug up things for one paper and then forget all the things. Instead, they are graded on their understanding of the subject. This is done by organizing periodic vivas with children and making them write reports on given topics.</p>

              <p>Students are given the freedom to choose their field interest in the sixth grade so that when they graduate school, they would already have a lot of skills in their field of interest and be capable of starting to work or go to college and master their skills.</p>

            <h1>ENERGY GENERATION</h1>
            <div class="montserrat">
              <p>Prasinada has energy generation factories on the outskirts of the city. It serves as the powerhouse of the city as all the energy requirements of the city are fulfilled by this area alone. It is divided into four sectors that tackle different energy requirements of the city.</p>

              <p>The first sector is called the ‘Hydromotive Production Sector’. This is the area where most of the city’s hydrogen-based energy is produced. This industrial area has a large power plant in which the chemical energy of hydrogen is converted into mechanical energy by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine. The input energy for hydrogen-based energy is produced by a system of large windmills.</p>

              <p>The second sector is called ‘Nuclear Energy Generation Plant’ which produces the energy required for various activities like research activities etc.</p>

              <p>Nuclear energy is used in many ways in the city. One of the most important uses of nuclear energy is water desalination. Water desalination is the process of removing salt from salt water to make the water drinkable. However, this process requires a lot of energy. Nuclear energy facilities provide a large amount of energy that desalination plants need to provide fresh drinking water.
                <a href="https://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/workshops/nucogen/presentations/8_Khamis_Overview-nuclear-desalination.pdf">Here is a link of a detailed document on how this works</a></p>

              <p>Another important use of Nuclear energy is by agriculture workers. Agricultural workers use radiation to prevent harmful insects. Irradiation also kills bacteria and other harmful organisms in food. This type of sterilization occurs without making food radioactive or significantly affecting the nutritional value. In fact, irradiation is the only way to kill bacteria in raw and frozen foods effectively. </p>
              <details>
                <summary><b>READ MORE/LESS</b></summary>

                <p>Another major sector is called ‘The Maglev Production Sector’ which deals with all the maglev and superconducting related matters of the city. Maglev trains are also made in this part of the industrial area.</p>

                <p> At last we have the ‘The Biomass Management Sector’. This is the most important sector as this produces the majority of energy required for the city.</p>

                <p>The raw materials used include dead plants (grown in a separate farm solely for this purpose), human and animal excrement, which are burned in an internal combustion reactor. The carbon dioxide produced from burning is sent into a large greenhouse where it is utilized by plants in the presence of sunlight to perform photosynthesis. The oxygen produced is used to produce water by reacting it with hydrogen gas and also in generating plastics.</p>

                <p>Plastics have become an inevitable part of our lives. We cannot completely cut down plastic production. Thus, to tackle this problem Prasinada has adopted the technique of Cold Plasma Pyrolysis. This process breaks down the Bisphenol-A in plastic molecules and produces hydrocarbons such as methane along with the evolution of hydrogen gas. The term cold plasma refers to plasma that is produced at room temperature. This plasma can be easily contained in simple devices such as a test tube but we use big reactors to contain it.</p>

                <p>The hydrogen-generating capacity of this process is about 50% (the 50% comprises methane and other hydrocarbons). Prasinada will be producing about 1 million tonnes of plastic annually out of which 75% is single used plastic. So if we plug in some numbers and do the math we find that we can generate 0.375 million liters of hydrogen gas annually. Which can be used in various fields along with electricity generation and powering hydrogen fuel based cars. </p>

            <h1>CITY'S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM</h1>
            <div class="montserrat">
              <p>Prasinada city is well connected to the outer world as well as maintains its own sacredism at the same time. This is due to the fact that Prasinada has a system of two circles namely the inner circle and the outer circle. Due to this, the city can be easily sealed if needed since unlike many cities, it has only seven entrances. This can especially be helpful during the time of an epidemic when communication with the rest of the world has to be terminated.</p>

              <p>Many times ambulances, which may be carrying or receiving a critical patient, get stuck in traffic. So to ensure that everyone gets free and instant ambulance services, the city has been laid with binary electric lines. On these lines run the ‘Elevated Ambulance’.</p>

              <p>These ambulances rise about 50 feet above ground which is way higher than the mammoth double-decker buses that run on the streets of London. These ambulances can prove to be very crucial in life-death situations.</p>

              <p>Prasinada promotes the use of hydrogen vehicles which ensures zero carbon emission. The fuel cell of the car generates electricity by converting the chemical energy obtained from the oxidation-reduction reaction of hydrogen with oxygen. Buses that run in the city are also dependent on hydrogen-based energy </p>

              <p>The city is equipped with maglev trains that are very swift and efficient when it comes to short distances as well as long-distance travel.</p>

              <p>These maglev trains use the Meissner Effect, which states that some superconductive elements would not allow magnetic fields to penetrate through their bulk. This effect causes magnetic levitation.</p>

              <p>Maglev trains can achieve a maximum velocity of 600 km/h or 375 mph. These trains save a lot of time and cause zero carbon emission. </p>
